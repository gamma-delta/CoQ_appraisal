# Appraisal

Adds an Appraisal skill tree that lets you judge things about an object by looking at them.

- Temperature
- Mass
- Mercantile Value
- Mutations
- Cybernetics

By default it gives you a range of values, but by getting the last skill in the tree (Transparent
Eye-ball) you get exact numbers.
